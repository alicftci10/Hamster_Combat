The homepage includes a search bar that allows users to display data from different tables in a unified view based on search criteria.
The "Top 10" button consolidates and displays the most profitable cards across all tables in a single table.![Ekran görüntüsü 2025-01-21 141610](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68101a0a-c092-4965-b70b-8eaaab0d66c6)

Additionally, the application features a countdown timer for time-limited cards. 
When the timer expires, the card is automatically removed from the Top 10 list, and a warning notification is triggered. 
This intelligent algorithm ensures seamless management of profitable cards and enhances the user experience.![Ekran görüntüsü 2025-01-21 141713](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3845009-7470-48e7-ad54-dab2b48ca182)
